# Pececillo

Pececillo is a mini-app derived from LANL's open source Truchas code for the
modeling and simulation of metal casting and additive manufacturing processes
(https://gitlab.com/truchas). It implements some Truchas physics models and
numerical algorithms in a simplified setting that retains their fundamental
computational character, while omitting non-essential features and modeling
capabilities. It is intended to be an agile platform where problems relating
to the parallel performance of the algorithms on advanced architectures can
be investigated.

The source repository for Pececillo is located at https://gitlab.com/truchas/pececillo
